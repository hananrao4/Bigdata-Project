Logistics Shipment Analysis Pipeline with PySpark and HDFS

# ETL pipeline:
â€¢	Extract (RDBMS via Sqoop)
â€¢	Transform (PySpark on HDFS)
â€¢	Load (Transformed data to RDBMS)
â€¢	Followed by visualization in Power BI.


# ðŸšš Logistics Shipment Analysis Pipeline â€“ Data Flow

# 1. Data Ingestion
â€¢	Source: RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle)
â€¢	Tool: Sqoop
â€¢	Purpose: Import logistics/shipment data from a relational database into Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

# 2. Storage (HDFS)
â€¢	Storage Medium: Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)
â€¢	Purpose: Acts as a data lake to hold large volumes of structured shipment data.
â€¢	Intermediate Step: Raw data is landed and staged here before any processing.

# 3. Transformation
Engine: PySpark (Apache Spark with Python)
Operations:
â€¢	Filter â€“ Remove unwanted records (e.g., incomplete shipments).
â€¢	GroupBy â€“ Group data by region, shipping partner, etc.
â€¢	Join â€“ Merge with other datasets like customer info, delivery logs.
â€¢	Aggregate â€“ Summarize metrics (e.g., total shipments, average delay).
â€¢	Select â€“ Choose specific fields relevant for reporting.

# 4. Serving Layer
Destination: RDBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
Purpose: Store the transformed and cleaned dataset in a structured format ready for visualization or business intelligence tools.





# 5. Reporting
Tool: Power BI
Purpose: Create dashboards and reports for logistics KPIs such as:
â€¢	On-time delivery rate
â€¢	Average shipment delay
â€¢	Carrier performance
â€¢	Shipment volume trends
